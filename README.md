## Overview:

I chose to go with **option A** and made a Tic Tac Toe game.

## Instullation needed:

All the packages used were implemented using CDNs which makes it unneccessery to install anything.

## Used Technologies:

The game was built around HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only with some images stationed at the assets files.

## The Taken Approach:

I designed the game to have turns in place effectively as odd turn and even turn, it worked great as a multiplayer game, but after adding the bot it went through some changes, it's not being monitored based upon the type of background each block.

It has an event listener in each block along with reset button and each time a block is clicked it changes its background to the player's mark, check the winning requirment then make an action with the bot and recheck the winning requirments.

## Unsolved Problems:

The game is essentially bug-free.

## Future Work:

The bot i designed here is a random one it was essentailly a step to follow it up with the unbeatable bot but i couldn't make it in time, i also wanted to make the first turn to be decided by rock-paper-scissors, game due to the nature of Tic-Tac-Toe the first player has a great advantage so i wanted to balance it.
